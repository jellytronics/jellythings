#jellythings


## Information

These are things that I've done for leisure.

Well let's get started.

Experiments contains all my digital and electronics experimentations
StartupScripts contains scripts that will help in the initialization of my Raspberry Pis and Servers
Ding Dangs contains all the nonsense stuff such as OVPN files and stuff.

This project(s) will be suspended indefinitely from 11th March 2014.


## Installation

- Git clone this

- Start install script

  ```sh
  cd ~/jellythings
  StartupScripts/install-all-allplatforms.sh
  ```

- Brew a cuppa coffee, chillout and Enjoy!!!

## Usage (Unified Interface)

- Type

  ```sh
  cd ~/jellythings
  StartupScripts/tmux_commander.sh
  ```

## Usage (Individual)

- You can run the individual startup scripts to init the components.

- Most of the applications "installed" are written by some other people so you should check out the relevant pages.

- I DO NOT RECOMMEND that you run the crontab altering script :P

  ```sh
  ~/jellythings/StartupScripts/cron_handler.sh
  ```

## Comments

I will try my best to work on the codes and iron out all the kinks (I'm a student btw)

All my homework and projects have been shifted into another git archive, (check those out)

I will port/fork whatever sub project within Experiments when the code matures and gains suitable applications externally.
