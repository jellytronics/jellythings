#jellythings


## Information

These are things that I've done for leisure.

Well let's get started.

Experiments contains all my digital and electronics experimentations
StartupScripts contains scripts that will help in the initialization of my Raspberry Pis and Servers
Ding Dangs contains all the nonsense stuff such as OVPN files and stuff.


## Installation

- Git clone this

- Start install script

  ```sh
  cd jellythings
  StartupScripts/install-all-allplatforms.sh
  ```

- Brew a cuppa coffee, chillout and Enjoy!!!

## Comments

I will try my best to work on the codes and iron out all the kinks (I'm a student btw)

All my homework and projects have been shifted into another git archive, (check those out)

I will port/fork whatever sub project within Experiments when the code matures and gains suitable applications externally.
