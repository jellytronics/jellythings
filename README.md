===========

Things that I play around with for leisure.

Well let's get started.

cs1020hw contains all my entries for cs1020 (Credits to NUS)
cs2020hw contains all my entries for cs2020 (Credits to NUS)
Experiments contains all my digital and electronics experiments
StartupScripts contains scripts that will help in the initialization of my Raspberry Pis and Servers

I will port/fork whatever relevant codes in Experiments when the code matures and is of any use.
